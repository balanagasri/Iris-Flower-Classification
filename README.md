# Iris-Flower-Classification

## Project Overview

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica** based on their sepal and petal measurements (length and width). The dataset used for this classification is the **Iris dataset** from scikit-learn. The goal is to train a model to accurately predict the species of an Iris flower given its features.

## Task Objectives

- **Data Exploration**: Analyze the Iris dataset and visualize its features.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for training by splitting it into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training**: Train multiple classification models, such as **Random Forest** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- **Feature Importance**: Identify the most important features contributing to the classification.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   First, clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Iris-Flower-Classification.git
   cd Iris-Flower-Classification
